### :zap: Infrastructure
- [patkub/infra](https://github.com/patkub/infra) | Cloudflare Access secured with Auth0 and passkey only login
  - Implemented Cloudflare Zero Trust Access integrated with Auth0 OpenID Connect (OIDC), including a custom Post-Login Action enforcing passkey only authentication.

  - Provisioned and managed all Cloudflare and Auth0 resources using Terraform to ensure repeatable, infrastructure-as-code deployments.
