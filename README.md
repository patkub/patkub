### :zap: Infrastructure
- [patkub/infra](https://github.com/patkub/infra) | Cloudflare Access secured with Auth0 and passkey only login
  - Implemented Cloudflare Zero Trust Access integrated with Auth0 OpenID Connect (OIDC), including a custom Post-Login Action enforcing passkey only authentication.
  - Secured remote access via short-lived SSH certificates and Cloudflare Tunnels, enabling passwordless SSH/VNC access without exposed ports or static SSH key management.
  - Provisioned and managed all Cloudflare and Auth0 resources using Terraform to ensure repeatable, infrastructure-as-code deployments.
- [patkub/ubuntu-setup](https://github.com/patkub/ubuntu-setup) | Bash scripts to setup my Ubuntu development environment from a fresh install

### :computer: Applications
- [patkub/mold-inventory](https://github.com/patkub/mold-inventory)
  - Developed a serverless mold inventory management system on Cloudflare Workers using Hono, Prisma ORM, Cloudflare D1, and Next.js, with authentication and authorization handled by Auth0.
  - Integrated a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows an LLM to securely access and retrieve mold inventory data on behalf of users with appropriate permissions.
