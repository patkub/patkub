<!-- Long Project Descriptions -->
[patkub/infra](https://github.com/patkub/infra) | Implemented Cloudflare Zero Trust Access integrated with Auth0 OpenID Connect (OIDC), including a custom Post-Login Action that enforces passkey only authentication. Secured remote access via short-lived SSH certificates and Cloudflare Tunnels, enabling passwordless SSH/VNC access without exposing ports or managing static SSH keys. Provisioned and managed all Cloudflare and Auth0 resources using Terraform to ensure repeatable, infrastructure-as-code deployments.

[patkub/ubuntu-setup](https://github.com/patkub/ubuntu-setup) | Created Bash scripts to automate the setup of a fresh Ubuntu development environment, including installation of Cloudflare Zero Trust, WARP, IDEs, SDK managers, and essential tooling.

[patkub/mold-inventory](https://github.com/patkub/mold-inventory) | Developed a serverless mold inventory management system on Cloudflare Workers using Hono, Prisma ORM, Cloudflare D1, and Next.js, with authentication and authorization handled by Auth0. Integrated a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows an LLM to securely access and retrieve mold inventory data on behalf of users with appropriate permissions.
